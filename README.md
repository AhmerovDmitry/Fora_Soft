In the test task, I needed to develop a simple application for the iPhone.
The application should display album artwork from the iTunes API,
and the user should be able to see detailed information about the selected album.

UI Description:  
• UISearchBar for start and stop searching  
• UICollectionView with albums  
• after selecting an album, I needed to display a screen with full information about the
album and list of songs
